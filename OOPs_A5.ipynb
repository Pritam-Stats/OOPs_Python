        "\n",
        "1. **Inheritance**\n",
        "    -  The  mechanism by which one class can inherit attributes and methods from another class. This enhances the code reusability and also prevents us from writing similar type of code multiple times for different classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Encapsulation**\n",
        "    - This allow us to protect and make some attribute and methods private of a class using `_` and `__  ` single underscore to protect and double underscore to make something private of a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Abstraction**\n",
        "    - Allow us to hide complicated implimentation and showing only the essential details.\n",
        "    - This allows us to create abstract classes and abstract method by using ther ABC and abstractmethod module from the abc library of python. Which gives a blueprint for the subclasses created from the abstract class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Polymorphism**\n",
        "    - Ability to use a single interface to represent different underlying forms (e.g., method overriding and method overloading)."
